## TODO
- [ ] Which kind of BSD is used?
- [ ] There is a 2-3 different coding styles in each file. Fix it!
- [ ] More examples, of course.
- [ ] Some comments is in Chinese. Tell developers, that this is **bad** idea.
- [ ] Maybe dub.json is better, than SDL. For example, there is no syntax hightlighting for it on GitHub.
